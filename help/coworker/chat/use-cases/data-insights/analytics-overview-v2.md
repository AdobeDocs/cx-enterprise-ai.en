## How data analysis works

Coworker Chat can perform advanced data analysis that was previously possible only in Analysis Workspace. Coworker Chat accesses data from your Customer Journey Analytics data views or Adobe Analytics report suites, allowing you to explore data and get answers with natural-language prompts.

Coworker Chat inherits permissions from Customer Journey Analytics or Adobe Analytics. You can access only those data views, report suites, dimensions, metrics, and segments available to you in Analysis Workspace.

When you create a visualization in Coworker chat, you can open it in Analysis Workspace any time for more manual control.

## Quick answers and deep-thought work

You can use Coworker Chat in two ways, depending on how much analysis you need:

* **Quick answers** - Ask a direct, plain-language question and get an immediate answer. Business users often use Coworker Chat this way, and analysts use it too when they need a fast answer for a stakeholder.
* **Deep-thought work** - Have an extended, multi-turn conversation with Coworker Chat to investigate a business problem, rule out causes, and arrive at a recommendation. Analysts typically use this approach to explore data in depth before making a recommendation.

## Start analyzing in Coworker Chat

Get started by describing what you want to know in plain language. Coworker Chat plans the analysis, queries your data views or report suites, and creates visualizations and summaries. 

The following use cases are grouped by what you want to accomplish. Each group lists the roles it's best suited for.

## Best practices when analyzing data with Coworker Chat

### Organization-level best practices

* Appoint an analyst from your organization as a Coworker champion.

* Create a library of vetted prompts and skills that correlate with the data and components that are available to users.

* Create one or more skills that direct Coworker Chat to use only those components that you want used in analyses. This helps Coworker Chat give users in your organization the most relevant data.

* Educate users on when to ask Coworker Chat for a quick answer versus when to use it for deep thought work.

### User-level best practices

* Use plan mode.

  This mode is especially useful for complex tasks, but can also yield better results for simple tasks because it allows Coworker to ask follow-up questions before acting. For more information, see [Plan mode](/help/coworker/chat/ui-guide.md#plan-mode).

* When creating a prompt, be as specific as possible:

  * Name the dimensions, metrics, and date range you want analyzed.
  * Reference components by their exact name.
  * Specify any segments, audiences, channels, or devices you want included, excluded, or compared.
  * State whether you want a specific visualization type, such as a funnel, trend, or cohort table.
  * Ask for recommended next steps if you want Coworker Chat to suggest follow-up questions.
  * Ask for a forecast horizon, such as "next 30 days," when projecting metrics.
  * Mention any hypothesis you already have, so Coworker Chat can validate or rule it out.
  * Ask for the contributing dimensions if you want a breakdown of a metric change.
  * Specify the audience for a summary, such as leadership or the marketing team, and request a slide deck outline if you plan to present the findings.
  * Name the specific report suite and data view you want to compare when validating data.
  * Complete an analysis first, then ask Coworker Chat to save it as a skill, giving it a clear, descriptive name and noting how often you plan to reuse it.

* Add standard directions to the Coworker Chat memory. For example, if you always use data from the same data views or report suites, add that to the memory. For more information, see [Add a data view or report suite preference in Memory](/help/coworker/chat/use-cases/data-insights/analytics-chat.md#add-a-data-view-or-report-suite-preference-in-memory) in Get started analyzing data with Coworker Chat.
